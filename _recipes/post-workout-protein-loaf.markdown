serves: 12
preparation_time: 10 mins
ingredients:
  Rolled Oats:
  Banana:
  Nut Milk (I use coconut or unsweetened almond milk):
  Cocoa powder:
  Honey:
  Nuts (I use walnuts):
  Seeds (I use a mix of Chia, Flax and Pumpkin):
  Fruit (fresh or dried):
  Whey protein powder:
steps:
- Mix oats, cocoa powder and whey protein powder in a bowl.
- Add mashed banana, a squeeze of honey and a dash of milk to make a sticky, story
  mix. It needs to hold it shape so don't make the mixture too runny.
- Add the nuts, seeds and fruit and stir to ensure they are evenly mixed throughout.
- Spread the mixture into a cake tin lined with grease proof paper and place in a
  preheated heated over at 200 degrees.
- Cook for 10 mins or until spongy but firm to touch. Remove the loaf from the grease
  proof paper whilst still warm and allow to cool before cutting into desired sized
  slices.
- Once cool the slices can be kept in the fridge for 3 days or frozen for about a
  month. I keep a stock in my freezer and simply defrost when required.

Protein is essential for muscle repair following a workout. Following a heavy workout, to avoid stuffing my face with everything the fridge contains, I created this protein loaf to keep hunger at bay whilst ensuring my body gets all the goodness it needs to refuel and repair.

The ingredients in this recipe don't have specific quantities, allowing the texture to be adjusted dependent on your taste. Once you've made the base mixture, simply as as many or little seeds, nuts and fruit as you would like.

### Why do you need Post-Natal Personal Training?

* Fast return to pre-pregnancy weight, stamina, strength and flexibility
* Encourages healthy lifestyle habits in your children
* Enhanced self-esteem, body image and confidence
* Better posture and less back pain

### Can you exercise yet?

Returning to exercise too early can damage your body, so you shouldn't exercise until you've had a Post-Natal check with your GP, which is usually around 6 weeks after birth. Once you've been given the OK, Post-Natal training should continue for 6 months after delivery, or 6 months after you finish breastfeeding. I'll be with you every step of the way to ensure you're exercising at a safe and healthy pace.

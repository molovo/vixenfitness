### Why do you need Ante-Natal<br />Personal Training?

* Prepare you and your baby for the demands of labour,
  and speed up your recovery after the birth
* Relieve pregnancy symptoms such as back ache
* Increase the amount of oxygen-rich blood delivered
  to your baby via the placenta

### How can I help?

I'm Gemma, a fully-qualified personal trainer, specialising
in Pre- and Post-Natal fitness. With the use of functional
exercise I can help you safely maintain your health, and
condition your body so that you're ready for labour
and the early days of motherhood.

### Is it safe?

With proper guidance, exercising whilst pregnant is not
only perfectly safe, but is actually highly beneficial,
both to you and your baby.

### How do you get started?

Sessions are **just £30 per hour**, can be done in the privacy
of your own home, and I'll bring all the equipment
we'll need — All you need is the motivation. You'll get a
personalised training plan, nutrition advice and as much
help and support as you need.

I'm Gemma Holloway, a Level 3 Qualified Personal Trainer, founder of Vixen Fitness and proud mum from Southsea. I am a mobile personal trainer, meaning that sessions can take place in a place with suits you, whether this be outdoors or in the comfort of your own home. I am also qualified in Ante/Post Natal exercise, meaning my client base also welcomes new mums.

## Services
### 1-2-1 Personal Training Sessions
Following a full consultation, personal training sessions follow a tailored fitness programme bespoke to the goals of the individual.

### Group Training Sessions
Sessions are tailored to the common goals of a small group of individuals (between 2-4).

### Ante/Post Natal Sessions
Taken on a 1-2-1 basis, these sessions focus on a fitness plan tailored to the goals and circumstances of the individual. Babies are welcome to attend these sessions. 

## My Journey
Due to a traumatic experience when giving birth to my daughter, I suffered PTSD and severe health anxiety. It was this that drove me to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Two years and 3 stone down, a healthy diet and regular exercise has helped me change my life!

I'm a true believer that whilst motivation is the key to getting started, it is enjoyment of the journey that keeps us consistent and progressing towards our goals.

I'm Gemma Holloway, a recently qualified fitness instructor and 28 year old mummy from South East England. Two years ago I gave birth to my beautiful daughter, Isla, but due to a traumatic experience I suffered PTSD and severe health anxiety. It was this that drove me to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Two years and 3 stone down, a healthy diet and regular exercise has helped me change my life!

I've made this website to share my ever continuing journey with you, and to offer advice and tips to help you on your way to living a happier, healthier life.

Let's get healthy together!!

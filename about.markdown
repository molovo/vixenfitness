I am a Level 3 Personal Trainer with additional qualifications in Ante/PostNatal Exercise. I offer sessions at 24/7 Fitness in Fareham as well as mobile personal training allowing you to train from the comfort of your own home, eliminating the need for childcare. 

## Services
### 1-2-1 Personal Training Sessions
Following a full consultation, personal training sessions follow a tailored fitness programme bespoke to the goals of the individual.

### Group Training Sessions
Sessions are tailored to the common goals of a small group of individuals (between 2-4).

### Ante/Post Natal Sessions
Taken on a 1-2-1 basis, these sessions focus on a fitness plan tailored to the goals and circumstances of the individual. Babies are welcome to attend these sessions.

### 4 Week Programme
Take ownership of your training with a 4 Week Programme tailored towards your goals. Ongoing remote support included. 

## My Journey
Due to a traumatic experience when giving birth to my daughter, I suffered PTSD and severe health anxiety. It was this that drove me to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Two years and 3 stone down, a healthy diet and regular exercise has helped me change my life!

I'm a true believer that whilst motivation is the key to getting started, it is enjoyment of the journey that keeps us consistent and progressing towards our goals.

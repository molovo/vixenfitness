Lots of people use a lack of motivation as their main excuse for not working out regularly. If this is you - then follow these rules! I use this simple set of guidelines to ensure my motivation doesn't waver. If you've got any motivation tips of your own, feel free to add them in the comments.

### Only wash your hair after a workout!

No one enjoys having greasy hair and let's face it, it doesn't look particularly appealing to others either. By only washing your hair after a workout, it encourages you to workout at least once every two/three days dependant on your hair wash routine.

### Impulse buy fruit/veg

Almost every healthy eating article will tell you exactly the opposite of this. But if I see fruit or veg on offer I buy it! Nothing puts a lid on motivation more than getting stuck in a rut with food. By buying what's on offer you are forced into cooking with produce you may not normally choose. Not only does this keep your tastebuds motivated with new flavours but it's also budget-friendly.

### Keep your workout wardrobe fresh

So this may not be quite as budget friendly as my previous point, but frequently adding new items to your workout wardrobe can help give your motivation the little boost it needs. I'm sure you know as well as I do, the burning desire to wear and show off a new outfit when you buy one! It's no different with workout clothing - when you look good, you feel good so buy yourself a new pair of leggings and go strut your stuff!

### Have a cheat day

It's important to have cheat days to reward ourselves for all the hard work we've been putting in. Incorporate a cheat day into your workout plan (although, make sure it's not so frequent that it hinders your progress. I'd recommend bi-weekly or even monthly if you can last that long). Only allow yourself to partake in that cheat day if you have followed your training Programme perfectly - no missed workouts, no nutrition slip ups. Having the cheat day in sight will make the journey feel even more worth while.

### Document your progress

If you only follow one of these guidelines - let it be this one. It's easy to feel like your stuck in a rut, especially if your only means of progress tracking is weight. Take pictures, document measurement and keep a diary of how you are feeling (mentally and physically). Look back at this documentation whenever your motivation feels deflated and remind yourself how far you have come!

So there you have it, my 5 top tips for maintaining motivation. Have any of these worked for you? Do you have any others to add? Let me know in the comments.

A treadmill is a great piece of equipment for getting in a good cardio workout but lots of people hate running on a treadmill because of various different reasons from impact on the joint to the sheer monotony of the task. Just because you don't enjoy running on the treadmill though,  doesn't mean you have to avoid it all together. Check out these 4 alternatives to getting the most out of this piece of equipment.

## Inclined Walking
This is great for those who avoid using the treadmill because of the impact running has on the joints, particularly on the knees. By using incline to increase the intensity of your workout, you can still raise your heart rate and get a good cardio workout, whilst keeping impact on the joints to the same as everyday walking. 

## Sprints
Ok, so technically this one is running but it does address the monotony associated with running on a treadmill. By sprinting for short bursts of time you turn your workout into a HIIT session, reaping all the benefits associated with this type of workout. Recommended time for sprint; 20 secs on, 10 secs rest. 

## Step Lift
This technique involves having the speed of the treadmill relatively slow and between each step, extending your leg straight out behind. This engages your glutes making it a great form of Cardio to incorporate into your booty workout.

## Walking lunges
Walking lunges engage your quads. They're great for building lean muscle in one of the largest muscles in your body which will help burn more calories on a day to day basis. Be sure to keep the speed of the treadmill slow enough that you can get fully down into the lunge, a slower lunge will work the muscle harder.

So why not try one of these alternatives and make the most of one of the most versatile pieces of equipment in the gym.
